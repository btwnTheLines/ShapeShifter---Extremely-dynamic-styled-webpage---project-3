        <h1>Welcome to ShapeShifter</h1>
        <p>The bush began to shake. Brad couldn't see what was causing it to shake, but he didn't care. he had a pretty good idea about what was going on and what was happening. He was so confident that he approached the bush carefree and with a smile on his face. That all changed the instant he realized what was actually behind the bush.
          <br><br>
          She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out o her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready. She looked deeply into his eyes and said, "Octopus."
          <br><br>
          There was nothing to indicate Nancy was going to change the world. She looked like an average girl going to an average high school. It was the fact that everything about her seemed average that would end up becoming her superpower.
          <br><br>
          He swung back the fishing pole and cast the line which ell 25 feet away into the river. The lure landed in the perfect spot and he was sure he would soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite would come from behind in the form of a bear.
          <br><br>
          They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.</p>

        <h3>How ShapeShifter works:</h3>
        <p>The styling of the page is changed using Javascript and CSS. The HTML is the basic skeleton which has the structure of the web page, so when you 
          click on one of the theme buttons the HTML stays the same (but can be changed if the code is tweaked, but that is not the focus for ShapeShifter), 
          however the CSS properties and/or CSS classes of the elements on the page are changed using Javascript to enable 'shape shifting' functionality.
          <br><br>
          CSS properties are specific styling properties of an element whereas a CSS class contains a number of CSS properties bundled together.
        </p>
